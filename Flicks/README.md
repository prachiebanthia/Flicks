# Project 1 - Flicks

Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent - including doing the lab at home: 15+ hours spent in total (I know!)

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters. Poster images load asynchronously.
- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User sees loading state while waiting for the API.
- [x] User sees an error message when there is a network error.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.
## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* Didn't do the lab in class -- took WAY too long working on that at home (got stuck on parsing the json correctly, and therefore didn't have enough time to devote to the actual assignment.)

* Can't figure out how to get rid of the weird white space on top of the app that comes from the 'hidden' error message.

* The whole app is slightly shifted in my simulator - I adusted some of the images so it looks ok, but I still think it's sort of weird.
